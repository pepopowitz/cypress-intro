Cypress is a new testing tool that can test anything that runs in a browser. Developers like it because it gives them a tight feedback loop for all kinds of tests - from testing individual units to full end-to-end scenarios. Quality engineers like it because the tests run reliably.

In this session, we'll look at how Artsy is using Cypress to enforce quality of our core business functions. We'll cover the basics, features, and shortcomings of Cypress, and look at example tests for many common scenarios. We'll cover different approaches to testing, and identify when and where Cypress shines brightest.

When it comes to testing, there is an invisible line drawn in many organizations. Developers manage unit and integration tests; quality engineers handle acceptance and end-to-end tests. Cypress has the potential to smash these silos. When dev and QA maintain the same set of Cypress tests, the team can align and focus on the most important thing: building quality software for their users.
