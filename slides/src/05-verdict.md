# The Verdict

---

Trail: Verdict

## Does Cypress replace Selenium?

### **No**

<!-- .element: class="fragment" -->

Notes:

the cypress team thinks it will eventually, they just have to resolve:

1) javascript only

2) cross-browser testing

but they wield strong opinions (limitations)

---

Trail: Verdict

## Cypress is a tool.

Notes:

It's useful

It can give you a lot of confidence to change your software

---

Trail: Verdict

## Cypress is young.

Notes:

It has a lot of growing to do

But it shows a ton of promise

---

Trail: Verdict

## Developers like to write Cypress tests.

Notes:

developers enjoying writing end-to-end tests can end one of two ways

which you end up following says a lot about the relationships of your organization.

1) no need for qa

2) ...

---

Trail: Verdict

## Developers and QA can **share ownership**.

Notes:

historically there's been a wall that devs chuck things over for qa to look at

but if we are co-owning the codebase

it's a chance for us to smash silos

and get totally cross-functional

and help each other out more

Trail: Verdict

## The pyramid doesn't have to be a pyramid anymore

Notes:

Now that integration & e2e tests are so much easier with Cypress,

we don't have to be bound to the pyramid.

We can use a shape that makes most sense to us

---

Trail: Verdict

TODO: image of just the pyramid

Notes:

And maybe that means _actually_ building a pyramid, instead of just unit tests

---

Trail: Verdict

TODO: image of ice cream cone

Notes:

or maybe we feel like the e2e tests, inspiring the most confidence of all tests, is where we want to focus

---

Trail: Verdict

TODO: image of diamond

Notes:

or maybe we really want to focus on the middle

and while we're at it, let's get rid of these tiers that don't make sense anymore

because it's not "e2e" vs "integration" that makes it hard

---

Trail: Verdict

TODO: image of diamond with scale of dependence vs independence

Notes:


it's "do my tests depend on something I don't control?"

unit tests don't. 

e2e tests do.

integration tests...depend on what they're all testing.

---

Trail: Verdict

TODO: image of diamond with two tiers

Notes:

and that's what separates the easy tests from the hard tests

are they independent? Do we control everything this test needs?

Or are they dependent on something out of our control?

...

Choose your shape
